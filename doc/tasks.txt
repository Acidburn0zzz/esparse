- checkParameters needs to check patterns, yes?  If it's a simple parameter
  list, then use the current strict-mode test.  Otherwise, any duplicate bound
  names are disallowed.  We'll need to have a function that gets the bound names,
  I suppose...
- Create summarized list of early errors we need to check for.
- For "super", we'll need to know whether we're in a class or not.  This
  will necessitate another flag in the context object, but there should 
  probably be a type string instead ("class,generator,async,etc")
- Unicode escapes should not make a reserved word??
- ClassElement: ; ?  What the hell is that for?

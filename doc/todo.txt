== TODO ==

- Extended string unicode escapes u{ HexDigits }
- Error messages should probably be constants.
- Should directives be a list, instead of just the one?
- Implicit Strict Mode:
  - ModuleBody
  - ClassBody
  - FunctionBody for generators, arrows
  ? FunctionBody for object methods
  

== Future ==

- Eventually we'd like to rewrite this using ES6 modules instead of
  Node modules.  It's not worth it for now (and for some time) because
  of the bootstrap issues.

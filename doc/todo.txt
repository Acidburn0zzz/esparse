== ES6 Features ==

- Generators, Generator Expressions, Array Comprehensions
- We currently don't allow the following binding form: { x = 123 }.

== Issues ==

- Can we parse "let" when we're not in strict mode?
- Hate using "kind" as a subtype.  Is "subtype" any better?
- For-in/of needs validation work.
- In strict mode, we need to go back and check the binding identifiers
  for the parameters of the function.
- It is a SyntaxError if any Identifier value occurs more than once within a 
  FormalParameterList of a strict mode FunctionDeclaration or FunctionExpression.
- Error messages should probably be constants.
- Make sure that we always call fail with a token, if appropriate.
- Should directives be a list, instead of just the one?
- Arrow functions are always strict.  There are other details...
- Research unicode issues.

== Future ==

- Eventually we'd like to rewrite this using ES6 modules instead of
  Node modules.  It's not worth it for now (and for some time) because
  of the bootstrap issues.
